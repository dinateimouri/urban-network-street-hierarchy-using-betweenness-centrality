# Urban-Network-Street-Hierarchy-Using-Betweenness-Centrality
Geographic features are crucial for navigation and spatial knowledge, taking many forms such as districts, barriers, rivers, lakes, and objects that are easy to recognize. Streets are especially important as their connectivity affects the flow of urban movement and determines how well individuals learn and remember the urban layout. Prominent streets that are frequently traveled are highly ranked in the hierarchical mental representation of spatial information. To reconstruct the hierarchy of streets in an urban network, one novel method is based on the interactions of wayfinders with streets in the city. This method suggests that the more prominent a street is, the more likely it is to be recognized by the wayfinder.

To rank streets in a street network and determine their hierarchical importance in the city network, one proposed method is to use the network measure of betweenness centrality. This measure determines the likelihood that a street lies on a shortest path between two other streets in the city. With more trips made by a wayfinder in the city, the betweenness centrality is expected to better approximate the wayfinder's experience of the urban environment.
